//Make UMLLLLLLL!!!!!!!

offender 4 can not be defended!

if the player rolls a number that is not apart of the defense there is no defense from the other player.

The people attacking and defending change

you can use a flag to determine which is attacking, true is player 1, and false is player 2.

you use if statements to control the spells and defense:
    -use what the chart says for each ting:

-Make menus with console pictures.
-Make sure you comment the librarys and other things on why your using it and how it helps you.

//Just simulate it
//You can clear console
//You can add methods if you need them


Main:
-Player p1 = new player();
-Player p2 = new player():
-currentPlayer = True;
//True is p1 and p2 is false

while loop(player1.heath > 0 and player2.heath > 0):
    Please enter the name of the defender and attacker players:
    p1.setName(getName())
    p2.setName(getName())
    p1.setHeath()
    p2.setHeath()

    //If the currentPlayer is true meaning player 1 than do offenser as p1 and defender as p2:
    if currentPlayer:
        p1.offenser
        p2.defender
        currentPlayer = False

    //Else the current is false meaning player 2 than do offenser as p2 and defender as p1
    else:
        p1.defender
        p2.offenser
        currentPlayer = True

    print out the defense for p1 or p2 and the offense for p1 or p2

#Example:

p1.set_Offense_PLayer_Health(x, y);
p2.set_Defense_Player_Health(y, x);
System.out.println(p1.getName() + "your health is now "+p1.getHealth);

Ask about roll 5 for protego!
and ask about 4 and 6

#Other Notes:

Abstract is ghost a temp!

You can have same method or varable names for different classes!
